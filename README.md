# ML Examples (coral based)

Short ml examples for data scientists using the coral edge TPU. 

* Using [deeplab](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/deeplab) and a [coral co-processor](https://coral.ai/products/accelerator/) this example demonstrates how to build a simple background blur effect for video conferencing.
